## Platformatic for Teams

<div> Node.js promises speed, agility, and scalability. In practice however, doing Node right has been a challenge for engineering teams, costing their companies cloud spend, downtime, and time-to-market. </div>

<p> Time and time again, weâ€™ve seen companies stumble when dealing with the same 5 issues: </p>

- Scaling based on CPU and memory.
- Preview environment limitations
- Getting the right Node.js metrics
- Not knowing what will break or which teams youâ€™ll impact when deploying APIs
- Figuring out which logger is right for you
